# E_Sec

Welcome to E_Sec, Cobus Meyer's first attempt at putting one of his ideas to work. Testing

  

## What is E_Sec?

  

E_Sec is going to be the leading provider of personalized security solutions aimed at residential estates and commercial property.

  

## Sooo, what are these devices?

  

This is a work in progress, and highly personalized to the requirements of the estate, but a range of standard products will be made available.

Something in the line of -

- Live monitoring of unauthorized vehicles within proximity of estate.

- Remote access to entrances, obviously, but with image recognition to identify and give access to authorized registration plates.

- AI guard at gate, for when all else fails and you have to converse your issues. (In this case, R100 will not let you in)

- High end border/fence security.

- Drone response for large estates, with live image feed to all residents.

- Mobile app for remote access of perimeter and disarming/arming of alarms.

- Voice activated panic alarm in every house, or a personalized panic gesture. A stroke on a specific patch of wall, or subtle stomp on ground.
- One touch safe room barricading
- Cyber protecting within proximity of estate (WIP, something in the line of a VPN cloud, where every internet connection within the "dome" is masked and untraceable) 
> Pipe dream - live mesh feedback of all biomaterial activity within perimeter

## Okay, and what exactly is the business?

The installation of this is obviously a big part, but the real business is the service provided afterwards. A subscription fee will keep all cloud related functions available, and offers direct contact to all emergency related services in the area for the quickest response possible.

## Cool, the team?
Uh yeah. Just me atm.
Obviously need some bright minds and deep pockets to help me.
